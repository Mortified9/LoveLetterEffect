Dear Daddy,

Thank you for being there with me through the bad times and the good times. Thank you for giving us or providing us with things we want. Thank you for takins us to places that we have'nt gone too before.

I know that you sacrifice so many things just so you can provide us a nice home,food,clothes and other good things.

Happy Birthday Daddy. We love you

From
